# Modern Frontend Django template repo 

There are many excellent Django templates out there. They all have different priorities and opinions. 

This template repo is different from the rest in that it's primary focus is frontend development. 

## Using the template

You could simply use this repo as a starting point for your own work - download it however you choose, and start adding your own code to the mix. 

Or you can poke around and use this as a learning resource. Make sure you understand how everything was wired up and why certain decisions were made.  

The latter is the best bet if you want to grow your own skills - it's likely that you will have different preferences, you might want to lay out your project in different ways and use different tools. That's perfectly normal. 

## Learning about the tools 

This template was brought to you by [Prelude](https://prelude.tech).
